              This feature allows a Student to find out whether he / she will get
              placed in the campus placement. The prediction made by the machine
              Learning Algorithm will be based on the previous recruitment
              statistics, and will also consider student data like academic
              details including all marks of every course done by the student.
              Prediction result can only be seen by the user itself and won't be
              shared to any recruiter. If the prediction is negative for a
              student, he / she can improve themselves by working more in the
              skills suggested by the recommendations.

              Finding out the right information from the vast internet can be
              difficult. Resource Sharing allows Coordinators to add resources,
              into a Storage System, which can be accessed by Students. The
              resources could be Video Tutorials, E-Books, and other resources.
              The Resources are stored in an Encrypted Storage System. There is no
              restrictions like department, semester etc. in data accessing. Once
              uploaded, it is publicly accessible by logged in students of any
              department or of any semester.

              Placement Statistics will be visible to everyone, which doesn't need
              to be logged in. This feature allows people to view the previous
              placement statistics like number of companies providing job
              opportunities, number of students placed, top salary offering
              companies, top recruiting companies etc. Since these data are
              public, it will be useful for students who are willing to join the
              college to know more about the placement details.

              Campus Placement Management feature allows recruiters to post jobs /
              internships with a detailed description like salary, requirements /
              qualification, selection process rounds, MCQ questions for rounds
              etc. Students can apply for the post they like and if they are
              eligible, they will be considered for the further recruitment
              process. Most likely the first round will be an MCQ round, and if a
              student passes the criteria set by the recruiter, the student can go
              to next level.

              Sometimes for some students, it may feel like there is not enough
              Campus Placements available. Using some third party APIs we provide
              information about external jobs posted by companies and students can
              attend them according to the criteria set by the recruiter who
              posted the job. Verification of legitimacy of those posts won't be
              the responsibility of any user / member in this Placement Management
              System.
